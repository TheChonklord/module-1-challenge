# module-1-challenge
This is my submission for the Module 1 Challenge project. Following the parameters laid out in the instructional README, I changed all of the div elements in the html file to semantic elements, such as article, main, body, etc. I believe that they follow the required "logical structure independent of style and positioning" as required in the Acceptance Criteria. I also gave it a title, gave alt descriptions for every image within the html file, and made certain that the html headings fell in a sequential order.
